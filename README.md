# HolidayProjects

Fellows from 6.3 fall 2019 cohort built holiday projects that they showcased at Pursuit. This app consists of the holiday projects that were built. 

HolidayProjects uses a **UIScrollView** to present a project details. A UIButton is used to segue via **SFSafariViewController** to take the user to the project's Github page. Dependecies for the HolidayProject are added using **Swift Package Manager**.
